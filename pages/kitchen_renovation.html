                <p>Rebuilding the missing cabinetry and updating the doors and drawer faces.</p>

                        <p>I moved from PA to southern AZ in April of 2022, and after a year and a half of renting, at two different 
                           locations, I decided I was ready to buy a home. The place I settled on was a blank slate - in good structural condition, 
                           but in need of some work and updating.</p>

                        <p>I decided to tackle the kitchen first. The cabinetry is original to the home and was installed in 1968. Its what’s
                            called Stick Built, which just means it was built in long sections, rather than as individual cabinets, as is
                            the modern practice. As you can see, about half of it was missing, and what’s left is in rough shape. Especially 
                            in areas adjacent to removed sections, due to the demo work.</p>
                            
                        <p>After going back and forth on what I wanted to do…tear it out and start over or try to repair and rebuild the 
                           missing sections, I went with the latter. I also decided to make new drawer fronts and doors to replace the 
                           dated look of stick built cabinetry..</p>

                        <p>After settling on a drawer / doors style, I then made one prototype lower cabinet, door, and drawer face/drawer box - 
                           designed to go to the right of the stove. I installed soft close hinges and drawer slides.
                           I was happy with how it came out so I used it as my template for the rest of the cabinets</p>

                        <p>It became immediately clear that the Ryobi table saw I had was not a great choice for this kind of work. 
                           I struggled with it, a chop saw and a skill saw and started upgrading my tools as my budget would allow. 
                           My son was kind enough to get me a DeWalt table saw for Christmas, which made life infinitely better! I 
                           also got a drill press, jigsaw and various jigs for installing hardware.</p>

                        <p>Next was a new spice rack made from scraps of cedar fence planks and some pine trim. I finished it with 
                           linseed oil.</p>

                        <p>I also made a wine glass rack (left) and plate rack (right). And, as you can see, a new counter top will be
                           need once the cabinetry is complete.

                        <p>I picked out hardware and I’m down to making the remaining doors and drawers. The only exception is the 
                            lower to the right of the sink. This will be gutted and house a dishwasher.</p>
