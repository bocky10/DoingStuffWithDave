                <h1>New Zealand Adventure</h1>
                <p>My son and I visited the south island of New Zealand during the last week of January, 2025.
                   Below are some of the highlights. 
                </p>

                        <p>We stayed at The Hemitage, which is located in Aoraki Mt. Cook National Park.
                           The hotel has undergone many iterations, dating back to 1884 . Its located 
                           about 9 miles from the foot of Mt. Cook.
                        </p>

                        <p>This photo was taken at Lake Pulaski. Most of the lakes in New Zealand exhibit 
                            this stunning blue color as a result fo glacial melt containing minerals that
                            scatter blue light.</p>

                        <p>Another stunning lake view taken in Twizel, NZ. Mt. Cook is to the left in the

                        <p>The town of Wanaka is really cool. The tree I'm standing by is called the 
                           Wanaka tree and its almost obligatory to be photographed in front of it. The
                           town has a great park system as well as lots of great restaurants and cafes.</p>

                        <img src="../photos/sheep_2.jpeg" alt="Photo from New Zealand">
                        <p>I had been complaining that in spite of how many sheep we had seen, I didn’t
                           have a chance to get any good pictures - and then this happened. We stopped 
                           as they crossed the road. The owner of the heard came to the car and told us 
                           to drive slowly towards them and they would move…so we did and like the Red Sea, 
                           they did in fact, part. At the back end of the heard was a guy on a four wheel 
                           and two sheep dogs doing there thing.</p>

                        <p>Milford Sound is part of a Unesco World Heritage site called Te Wahipounamu. 
                           Otherworldly, with mountains, cliffs and waterfalls that all seem too big 
                           and beautiful to be real. Its part of Fiordlands National Park.</p>
