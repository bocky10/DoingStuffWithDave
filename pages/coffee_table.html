                <h1>Wood & Metal Project - Coffee Table
                </h1>
                <p>Part way through my kitchen renovation, I needed a break from building cabinets. 
                    I had an idea for a coffee table and some coasters. It was a good way to use up 
                    some scrap wood and a chance to do something creative. I also got to fire up my 
                    arc welder for the first time in 3 years!</p>
                <div class="photo-row">
                    <div class="photo-item">
                        <img src="../photos/table_overview.jpeg" alt="Photo 1">
                        <p class="photo-text">
                                              <p>The table top is made of three 8” pine planks. I used a dowelling jig, 1/4” dowels, wood glue and 
                                              bar clamps to assemble top. Anyone whose worked with pine knows there’s not a strait piece to be found, but I love the 
                                              look, so I wrestled the warping into submission…well mostly.</p>
                                              <p>I edged the table with pine trim, mitered at the corners.</p>
                                              <p>I used 3/8” rebar for the hairpin legs. Using some pipes for leverage, made bending them into 
                                                shape relatively easy and I built a jig for welding them. That was tricky but they all came 
                                                out very consistent. The mount plates were made from steel flat stock. I cut and welded them 
                                                into an “L” shape, and used my drill press to drill out the mounting holes.</p>

                        <p class="photo-text"><p>The star pattern on the table top and coasters, was done with both oak and poplar dowels, just to get some color 
                            variation. I laid out the pattern with a compass and a carpenter’s square. I made the dowells about 
                            1/4” too long, glued and tapped them in place, and cut them flush with a Japanese pull </p>

                                                <p>Two of the coasters are a composite of pine, mdf and plywood, that I glued together into a cube. I then drilled holes 
                                                    for dowels. Once the glue dried, I used the table saw to slice them down to size and sanded / finished them. The 
                                                    third one was made from a scrap of the spice rack I made.</p>
